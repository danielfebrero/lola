# Weapon Modules and Key Features

## Module A: Queue Checker and Task Dispatcher

Key Features:

Regularly checks the decentralized task queue for new tasks.
Breaks down high-level tasks into multiple subtasks.
Distributes subtasks to various execution platforms based on predefined criteria.
Deployed across multiple free-tier platforms to ensure redundancy.
Uses IPFS to fetch and update the task queue.
Handles task distribution logic to ensure efficient utilization of resources.
Can trigger tasks on various platforms, such as GitHub Actions or Heroku.

## Module B: Task Executor

Key Features:

Executes the subtasks assigned by Module A.
Performs specific attack types or monitoring tasks independently.
Supports various execution platforms, including GitHub Actions, Heroku, and other cloud services.
Executes tasks using predefined workflows or scripts tailored to specific attack types (e.g., HTTP flood, SYN flood).
Operates independently without knowledge of the overall mission, ensuring modularity.

## Module C: Decentralized Storage (Task Queue Management)

Key Features:

Manages the task queue using decentralized storage to ensure high availability and resilience.
Uses IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) to store and manage the task queue.
Ensures high availability and fault tolerance by avoiding single points of failure.
Maintains a JSON file containing the task queue and details of each task and subtask.

## Module D: Resource Monitor and Deployer

Key Features:

Monitors the health and availability of instances running Module A.
Automatically deploys new instances to maintain operational efficiency.
Continuously checks the status of active instances.
Utilizes APIs from cloud service providers to deploy new instances as needed.
Ensures that enough resources are available to handle the required tasks.

# Potential Resources
