# High level model identification

- machinev/idefics-9b-LPU_model: optimized for float16 GPU, fine tuned Huggingface model
- Lewdiculous/Halu-8B-Llama3-Blackroot-GGUF-IQ-Imatrix: no refusal, meta flagship model, intermediate matrix for accuracy, quantitized for inference speed
- 0dAI/0dAI-7.5B-v2-4bpw: cybersecurity
- yuweiyin/FinBench (dataset): used to fine a model that could predict fraud risk (credit cards, loans...) based on recent human behaviors
