When you search within a repository for the first time, please note that the repository undergoes indexing. This process may take a few minutes.

The index currently includes more than 70 million popular public repositories, plus all private repositories that users search for.

Beyond that, we also don't include all files in the search index:

Vendored and generated code is excluded
Empty files and files over 350 kiB are excluded
Only UTF-8 encoded files are indexed
Very large repositories may not be indexed

We intend to continue to increase the amount of code available in the index as much as possible. If we are missing files that are useful to you, feel free to provide feedback here.
